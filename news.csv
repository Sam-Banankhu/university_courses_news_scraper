MUBAS procures surveying equipment,Hazviperi Mbizi,"September 9, 2021","The procured equipment include; Normal Total Station, Robotic Total Station, Global Positioning System (GPS), Laser Scanner and Drones from Leica GeoSystems.The Head of Department for land Surveying, Chikondi Mphamba explained that, a total station is an optical instrument commonly used in construction, surveying and civil engineering. The uses of normal total station and robotic total station are similar; the only difference is in its functionality during the field work. Robotic total stations allow for more technological convenience.“Laser scanning is a very efficient survey method to reduce costs. Surveys are realized by a laser scanner, which allows a fast surveying (scanning) of landscapes, structures and their furnishings and arrangements as well as installations,” Mphamba added.In surveying, drones are used to capture aerial data with downward-facing sensors, such as RGB or multispectral cameras and LIDAR payloads. During a drone survey with an RGB camera, the ground is photographed several times from different angles, and each image is tagged with coordinates.Speaking when receiving the equipment, the Dean of the faculty of Built Environment Gilbert Chilinde explained that programmes in their faculty are more practical than theory, so without the equipment it was very hard for lecturers to deliver lessons effectively.“We are grateful to management for this advanced expensive equipment which will enable students to work with the latest equipment and increase their skill sets. It will also help them to perform ‘hands-on’ study of laser scanner, GPS, Total Station and Drone application which in return give them a real edge in the marketplace as they launch their professional surveying careers,” said Chilinde.In her remarks when handing over the equipment, the Acting Vice Chancellor Associate Professor Nancy Chitera advised the staff in the department to make full use of the equipment in making sure that students are getting the best hands-on training.“My appeal to you is to use these machines to make an impact in the development of the country. As an academia you can use these for consultancy, research and innovation which could also help generate funds for the department,” said Associate Professor Chitera.She further urged them to take proper care of the equipment to ensure sustainability so that it can be used for a long period of time.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/mubas-procures-surveying-equipment-09-09-2021

It uses a simple process in which food is brought to boil, simmered for few minutes and put in the fireless cooker to continue cooking,” narrated Kaipa.MUBAS Acting Deputy Vice Chancelor, Associate Professor Betchani Tchereni commended Kaipa for coming up with this project. He further said that this is what MUBAS envisage, to produce graduates who are innovative and have entrepreneurship skills which they could use in future.Kaipa added that, there is wanton cutting down of trees almost across the whole country, Malawi hence it causes global warming and climate change.“Although this is the case, the government of Malawi is striving to curb this through many initiatives like the use of chitetezo mbaula. Even though there are such initiatives, there is still the problem of cutting down of trees, since those initiatives are the cause of lost energy when cooking,” said Kaipa.Kaipa’s vision is to get financial and professional support which could help him produce these in bulk and sell at an affordable price to those who use charcoal and firewood for cooking.Kaipa can be contacted on; 0880176771",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/mubas-student-creates-fireless-cooker-09-09-2021

Students engaged in market survey,Joseph Ulemu,"August 24, 2021","The market survey was in conjunction with Consumers Association of Malawi. Its aim was to enable students appreciate and better understand issues affecting consumers in as far as food quality and safety is concerned.The students who were split into two groups, went round the said markets and chains stores where they interviewed different people on a wide range of food items they sell. The interviews probed into how those selling food items such as perishables, cooking oil, meat and meat products manage their businesses to ensure that the food is fit for human consumption.They inquired on how sellers ensure hygiene of their business premises and whether their premises and commodities were inspected by the City Assembly. They also interviewed them on how long they keep assorted food items on market and how they are disposed off in case of damage or expiry.Lecturer for the Food Legislation and Safety module, Dr. Gertrude Sitolo Banda, who is also the Acting Dean of Students, said that such market surveys are part of students’ academic activities. She further said that these assignments give them a chance to exercise their rights and responsibilities as consumers.“Doing this market survey, gives them an opportunity to appreciate what they learn and should apply the theoretical framework into practice. Being final year students, we emphasise much on the application of the knowledge and skills acquired through the years as we prepare them for the industry,” said Banda.One of the students, Obvious Charles, expressed her gratitude for the activity they undertook. She added that it has complemented a lot to their theoretical understanding of the course.Said Charles “The survey has helped me to easily apply the knowledge gained. As food scientists, we have the responsibility to ensure that the food products are safe for consumption and raise an alarm any anormalies are noted.

Our universities are home to two engineering design studios—a relatively new concept here that supports hands-on design and innovation by our students.When COVID-19 began, we and our design studio teams asked: How do we help? What can we contribute to Malawi? What can our innovators develop locally to help Malawi respond to and prepare for this pandemic?As a small, land-locked country, Malawi imports most things. Now with COVID-19-related travel and import restrictions, Malawi’s solutions for personal protection equipment and other technologies for the fight against COVID-19 must be locally sourced.Local Malawi creativity and innovation has a home in our design studios at the University of Malawi – The Polytechnic (Poly) and Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST). Our studios provide local university students and faculty with access to 3D printers, laser cutters, supplies, and resources required to help them innovate, design, prototype and deploy new technologies—a revolutionary way to engage students in engineering through hands-on development. The studios are modeled after the Oshman Engineering Design Kitchen, founded by our partner university, Rice University, in Houston, Texas, and supported by The Lemelson Foundation.While our design studios predate COVID-19, they are proving their worth during these times, as they play a critical role for biomedical engineering support for Malawi.READ FULL ORIGINAL ARTICLE",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/malawi-design-studios-poly-must-provide-locally-sourced-ppe-technologies-to-respond-to-covid-19-19-02-2021

CHANCO’s main point was Malawi has not utilized the full potential of hydro-electric power luring the service providers as the ones that are letting Malawi down while Polytechnic’s main point was hydro-electric power has proven to be a failure therefore it is time we look on alternative power sources.After some deliberations the judges pronounced the Polytechnic as winners and will progress to the next round of the competition.The Polytechnic ABAS publicity secretary Mathews Mangawa couldn’t hide his delight on the outcome of the debate as he commended their team for the hard work.“I think the debate was a 50-50 because the CHANCO team also provided brilliant arguments but our team did better in collecting relevant data, and we worked hard on that. I think at the end hard work has paid for us,” said a jubilant Mangawa.One of the CHANCO students who participated in the debate, a 3rd year Bachelor of Social Science Ian Khonje commended the EU and ECAMA debates saying they have taught them other ways of approaching debates.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/poly-victorious-22-10-2019

Most girls do not put so much effort in their studies, which contributes to their failure. In addition, most girls indulge in sexual relationships with truck drivers as the district is close to the border,” Khudze said.As a result, the group decided to visit these girls to empower them, stand as role models, motivate them and also to discuss how best they can handle the adolescence stage, since ignorance to this leads to early pregnancies resulting into school drop outs.Khadze further explained that the girls were so much excited to have such kind of a talk as it challenged them to think outside the box and never undermine their potential.“A form 2 student, informed us that peer pressure and lack of school resources are some of the challenges. As a way to overcome peer pressure she suggested that girls should get to know their values and associate with right people who add value to their lives,” she outlined.The team has planned to visit more girls, especially those from rural areas, and share knowledge on how they can advance in their education and make right choices in life.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/say-no-to-early-marriages-18-10-2019

We therefore have decided to launch this campaign whose mission is to mobilize and motivate girls in the engineering field as well as inspiring them to explore what engineering is all about.”He further explained that the activities aligned to prosper the campaign will include workshop training, programming sessions, entrepreneurship classes and lecturing sessions.“Girls seem to have difficulties in modules concerning Mathematics, Science and Mechanics, we have therefore found a better, easier and enjoyable way of learning these modules,” narrated Simwaka.One of the girls involved in engineering studies, Debbie Sulungwe, who is studying advanced Diploma in Tele-Communications also commended the initiative upon hearing of it.“It’s a very good initiative because girls are indeed lacking behind when it comes to engineering studies. In my class for example there were only 3 of us (girls) in a class that has about 40 students,” explained Sulungwe.“I think the problem is mentality, girls seem to think engineering is a male-oriented profession or the society makes us to think that way but when we remove that mentality and focus on the job at hand and practice it whole heartedly, you will realize it’s a doable profession,” she added.The campaign is expected to run for the whole semester, classes or sessions will be conducted from Friday to Sunday in the afternoon.

Let’s preserve trees,Hazviperi Mbizi,"August 30, 2019","A laboratory assistant, Kingsley Kabango explained that a briquette is a compressed block of combustible biomass material like sawdust, rice husks, groundnut shells, waster papers, cow dung, wood chips and banana peels, used for fuel and kindling to start a fire.A project, which is also being done by some organisation in the country, the department, thought it wise to be part of those trying to protect trees which are being cut carelessly.“Briquettes are economical in such a way that they use locally found materials to be produced. If the society or industries could help us expand this project, there could be a solution to climate change and deforestation,” Kabango said.He further outlined that the adoption of briquettes as a locally found fuel, would also help in job creation for people in industries.Speaking after using the briquettes as an experiment, Jane Saguga, a lady from Ndirande explained that these are even way better than charcoal because they last longer and they do not produce smoke.The department intends to expand this project so that it should be producing them in bulk to be sold at an affordable price so the community should benefit.According to National Charcoal Strategy (NSC) report, 97 % of households in Malawi rely on charcoal and firewood as their primary cooking fuel and Malawi’s demand for these fuels is increasing faster than the adoption of alternative energy sources.In this regard, trees are being cut carelessly which leaves the land bare and prone to floods.

Areas visited were Chitawira, Mount Pleasant, Chichiri and Mandala.“Despite meeting challenges like lack of finances, in adequate time and tough landlords, we still managed to collect data and finished the project,” Lapozo said.This map is accessible on the Polytechnic website which can be logged in everywhere in the country through a smartphone or computer.According to the Land Surveying lecturer Mr. Ritchie Muheya, the project is one of the core modules for the award of the Bsc in Land surveying. He further highlighted that students are required to employ the techniques, cartography, photogrammetry in the surveying and mapping module (SMP).“To come up with this project, they managed most of the required modules in SMP,” he added.Polytechnic Student Union (PSU) Publicity Secretary, Joseph Kaluzi observed that, this is a good initiative as it is going to ease problems of accessing places to rent as it has been a struggle especially for first year students.“This map will also assist the PSU to monitor where the students are accommodated and the conditions they live in,” Kaluzi explained.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/navigation-of-private-hostels-made-easy-20-03-2019

Protecting women from Cervical Cancer through innovation,Chapter Banda,"March 18, 2019","These kits will be used to sharpen, familiarize and teach medical practitioners the skills that they should have, before going for cervical cancer screening.The cervical cancer training models have been designed in gel-based shape of the cervix that are substantially cheaper, portable and more palatable than plastic or meat models.The kits are being manufactured at The Malawi Polytechnic Design Studio by using locally available resources such as wood, PVC pipes, fabric and foam.Mia started working on the project when he was undergraduate student at The Polytechnic where he studied Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering.The idea came in after he had a chance to do an internship at Rice 360 Institute for Global Health in his fourth year of studies in 2016.“When I was doing my internship at Rice University together with my fellow students from Rice we were given lists of different projects to work on. From these lists, I decided to venture in the project of developing cervical cancer training models that are cost-effective in developing countries,” he reminisced.He added that he was shocked to realise that Malawi has highest world’s cervical cancer rate.“Learning about the extent to which Malawians were affected by cervical cancer motivated me to work on this project,” he added.According to the Studio Director, Brittany Allen, the project provides an ideal example of how local innovators can use the resources around them to design a scale up products so that they can have an impact on communities around them.“Waheed Mia’s Project started as a collaboration between The Polytechnic students and Rice University and is a great model of how two countries can work together to create high-impact solutions to global problems,” Allen stated.There are a number of tools that are available for the early detection and treatment of Cervical Cancer and its precursors in low-resource settings.However, there are commercially available mannequins that help to teach cervical cancer screening skills, but these simulators are costly to be used in developing countries like Malawi.To practice biopsy, cryotherapy, and a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), often models with animal tissue likes of beef tongue are used. Therefore, this is messy and easily contaminated, and it is impractical in some areas across Malawi.These models have also been trialled in medically underserved parts of Texas, as well as El Salvador, Malawi and Mozambique.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/protecting-women-from-cervical-cancer-through-innovation-18-03-2019

This delays their studies which should have been finished in time,” He added.Speaking on the sponsorship, a Master in Business Administration student Higga Mkandawire, welcomed the development.“Most companies are failing to be productive because they lack people who have the expertise which are taught in different postgraduate programs,” Mkandawire said.He further explained that due this program, students will be encouraged to study and complete their programs hence become productive in their respective work places.A Master of Arts in Health and Behavior Change Communication final year student, Paul Mphepo, concurred with Mkandawire pointing out that it is a great initiative that will help improve research standards among post graduate students.“Postgraduate research findings have the potential of contributing towards improvement, change in practice, operations and policies,” he explained.Mphepo further outlined that government and the private sector can get more insights from the research findings and act on the recommendations.“It will also motivate the students to conduct challenging and quality research to justify the funding and support,” Mphepo added.Mphepo suggested that there is need for government to consider funding dissemination conferences where the students can share their findings to the general public.Laurine Meke, another post graduate student also observed that it is a good development as it will enhance research in the country.“We have for so long sang this song ‘Malawi is under developed’, how do we develop if we do not invest in new knowledge and research?,” She wondered.Meke added that she wishes the Ministry of Education should extend this program to undergraduates and everyone interested in research.She also asked the private sector to come in with this kind of sponsorship.Applicants are advised to submit their application packages by email to kalizangomarosed@yahoo.com or valezimpita@gmail.com not later than 25th January, 2019.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/postgraduate-students-breathe-sigh-of-relief-22-01-2019
New structures transform Polytechnic’s face,Hazviperi Mbizi,"January 22, 2019","The Vice Principal, Dr Nancy Chitera, explained that these buildings are being constructed in regards to the pillars of the National Education Sector Plan. In their strategic plans, one of the pillars is to provide access to higher education.“As an institution we decided to abide by this pillar by increasing the number of students.

This enabled him to gain popularity among the youth and his target audience.A Born Again Christian, Walani uses his talent to spread the gospel of Jesus Christ to his fellow youth on both the Polytechnic Campus and beyond.“In 2016, a producer Mr Chembe sponsored my first album titled Akulilira Bonus alibe phone after listening to just part of my work,’ Walani explained.He also highlighted his goals as aspiring to be a poet who just doesn’t write for fun but also pierce people’s hearts and fully communicate with his audience.“I want reach to a point where my audience will not have a choice but listen to the poems based on how nicely they have been presented. I also write and recite to praise Jesus Christ,” He elaborated.Walani expressed that he manages his time properly so that this should not jeopardize his studies being a University student.A fellow poet, Sam Brand who is also a second year Bachelor of Business Administration at the Polytechnic, spoke highly about Walani’s talent.“Chikumbutso is a poet who knows how to play with words. His wind-up of the poems is unpredictable but in the end we get the information he intends to put across,” Brand explained.Sam Brand added that, he single out one of Walani’s poems titled Sadadye Bread which he says one could think of the local bread yet he meant Jesus Christ as the bread of life.Desire Chikagwa commended Walani’s poems especially Ngati filimu ya Naijeria which she says it is meaningful, inspiring and creative.“From the time I met Chikumbutso Walani he has been a great inspiration to us in many angles of life,” the Information System student explained.Vincent Nowa, a fourth year Civil Engineering student concurred with Brand by stating that Walani’s work is innovative and ‘out of the box.’“He has created an energy source out of the ordinary materials. It is a thing only creative minds would think of. His work is outstanding and so topnotch,” Nowa explained.So far, Walani has released only one album and a lot of singles like Chiombankhanga, Yesu ndi machine and the recent Ngati Filimu Ya Naijeria.“I like releasing singles because people are always lazy to finish listening to the whole album. When it is a single, they have time to appreciate the message, creativity and talent portrayed in it,” Walani further explained.MBC journalist David Kapezi recorded Walani’s poems and played them on the program called Good Morning Malawi on MBC radio.Chikumbutso plans to release yet another single in February 2019.

Furniture replacement at Polytechnic,Hazviperi Mbizi,"January 8, 2019","The project was put in place by the committee after conducting research which was done by the office of the Estate Development Officer. The office identified the need since there was an outcry from the members of staff that the incumbent furniture was either old or insufficient.The project which is being funded by the Malawi Government under the Public Sector Infrastructure department commenced in January 2018 after a proposal was submitted.The Polytechnic’s Estate Development Officer, Blessings Hudge explained that the committee followed the whole procurement procedures through the Office of The Public Procurement and Disposal of Assets Authority.“We embarked on trying to find a supplier who was going to supply adequate furniture by taking into account the landing cost, quality and quantity,” Hudge explained.After proper scrutiny and enquiries from Chancellor College and LUANAR, the committee opted for a Chinese supplier.“We opted for a Chinese supplier because if we compared the costs and quality to the local suppliers, the local ones were on the higher side, so in order to cut costs, the furniture was purchased in China,” She elaborated.So far, the progress could be rated at 90% as most offices and classrooms have been furnished. The only classrooms remaining are the New Technical Education block and some offices which are supposed to relocate to the new office blocks being constructed.Hudge added that the committee is yet to decide on what should be done with the old furniture once the project is completed.An accountant Nditani Makawa and a secretary at the registrar’s office, Sarah Juma both expressed satisfaction on the new furniture while observing that the chairs are more comfortable and the desks have bigger drawers than the old ones.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/furniture-replacement-at-polytechnic-08-01-2019

Food Science laboratory producing nourishments,Hazviperi Mbizi,"December 13, 2018","According to the lecturer in charge, Ulemu Chimimba, she thought of utilizing the skills as food scientist by producing various foods like, fruit juices, milk shakes, yoghurt, cakes among others which could be sold to lecturers and students.“In this department we teach food science, I decided to use the same skills to help in generating income for the renovation of the food laboratory,” Chimimba explained.Chimimba added that since the college teaches theory, she thought it wise to start teaching students the practicality of food science so that whenever they graduate they should acquire both practical and theory skills.“Food has the power to kill people if it is not properly prepared, however, this program will encourage students to be passionate about it. This will enable them to identify irregularities in the food production, in the industry,” She elaborated.In order to ensure that the produced food contains the appropriate ingredients, Chimimba works hand in hand with the laboratory technician Patricia Kamwachale.Kamwachale explained that this department has the advantage of having the food tested at the biology and chemical laboratories which are all under this same faculty.“Since all these laboratories are at our disposal it is an added advantage for the food scientists to have a fill of food production while at school before going to the industry,” Kamwachale explained.The Dean of Faculty of Applied Sciences Ishmael Kosamu commended the development by the Food Science lecturer’s initiative in both revenue generating activities and also equipping students with practical skills.“This is a welcome development because it helps students to gain confidence in practicing what they learn in class, at the same time food is easily accessible and convenient on campus,” Kosamu explained.One of the customers, Head of Department in the Language and Communication, Victor Chikoti, expressed his satisfaction on one of the products he purchased produced at the Food laboratory.“The juice is very good, the taste is natural, it has no sugar, no preservatives which makes it 100% mango juice proudly made right here at the Polytechnic,” Chikoti observed.A final year student of Environmental Science and Technology, Moses Sumani, explained that the production of these products gives students an opportunity to have hands on experience.“As final year students we are able to link theory to practice at the same time, appreciating science and technology behind food production,” he added.The Food Laboratory is being registered under the Malawi Bureau of Standards Act in order to have a food license which will authorize it to provide catering service within and outside the Polytechnic.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/food-science-laboratory-producing-nourishments-13-12-2018

PSU introduces HIV Self-Testing Kits to students,Hazviperi Mbizi,"December 11, 2018","According to PSI’s Demand Creation Coordinator, Brian Satha the aim is to provide HIV testing kits to individuals, in this case students, with limited time and no access to HIV testing facilities.“HIV self-testing also has the capability to reach populations with barriers to the conventional HIV testing, such as; distance to health facilities, confidentiality of results and health provider attitude,” Satha explained.Satha further explained that the overall goal is to compliment to the national HIV response in which young people and men have been identified as the groups with HIV testing gap, hence the selection of the Polytechnic institution.“For every individual accessing HIVST, we provide pretest information. This is a condensed package that includes; what to observe before using the kit, what to do to get correct results, how to perform the test and interpret results and lastly what to do with results. A demonstration on how to use the kit is also provided,” Satha added.According to the Director of Health and Sanitation of the PSU, Innocent Mndala, Malawi is one of the countries that have adopted the 90-90-90 campaign which emphasize that 90% of the population should know their HIV status. This may encourage those that are diagnosed reactive to embark on ART treatment in order to initiate viral suppression.“This exercise was done as a way of helping the country in achieving the 90-90-90 campaign. It is hard to achieve this campaign if the country does not have enough health facilities for HIV testing and also for the fear of lack of privacy,” Mndala Said.Mndala added that there has been positive response from the students because it is simple and straight forward to test themselves since it just requires saliva as the testing fluid.Concurring with Mndala, a Bachelor of Science Industrial Laboratory Technology student Rueben Banda explained that many students do not take the initiative to go for HIV testing. Therefore the introduction of the Self-testing Kit on campus has increased the number of volunteers because of its nature and accessibility.“This exercise is relevant to us in the sense that students need to know their HIV status in order to prevent transmission to others if found positive or start practicing abstinence if found negative,” Banda explained.Banda further explained that this program is a starting point for the students when planning their future because they are assured of how they can plan their lives.PSI-Malawi with funding from UNITAID is implementing the HIV Self-Testing Africa (STAR) project which is distributing HIV Self-Test Kits (HIVST) under different distribution channels in Malawi.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/psu-introduces-hiv-self-testing-kits-to-students-11-12-2018

"Raphael Tenthani series reflects on training and practice of Journalism, PR in Malawi",Chapter Banda,"December 6, 2018","A public lecture which was held in the Raphael Tenthani Centre for Media Excellence at the Polytechnic Chichiri Campus, brought a lot of key stakeholders in the Media Industry including the representatives from the government, corporate world and academia.The lecture was presented by a lecturer in the Department of Language and Communication Skills of Chancellor College, a constituent college of the University of Malawi, Dr Sydney Kankuzi, titled ‘ Journalism and Public Relations (PR) in Malawi: Reflections on Training and Practice.’Kankuzi began his presentation by tracing a historical background on how these two disciplines are related to each other.He used the thoughts of Edward Bernays to explain how Journalism and PR were being practiced then, who later his thoughts were influenced by Water Lippmann’s thoughts. The thoughts focused on the need of PR to work with Journalism to complement its positive role in the society.To answer the question, why does PR have negative connotation in today’s journalism, Kankuzi also traced some factors that influenced it.He said the two disciplines started working separately as the influence of United Kingdom and United States of America.“In the United Kingdom, PR began to wear a new face in 1940s, during the war period. This was so, because the government was under increasing pressure from people who were impatient with the continuation of wartime controls and rationing,” he explained.He added that as the communication increased in the complexity and became more staged it shifted from its original essence and became less justified.Kankuzi also further explained how PR has greatly affect Journalism globally and Malawi is not an exception.“Globally, the rise of PR is increasingly undermining the legacy of journalism in the society, and Malawi is not an exception to this phenomena,” he said.He further said with the growth of the internet and other Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), every organization in now somehow a media house in its own right and often, at the expense of journalism. Due to that, PR is depending on journalism less and less while journalism is increasingly depending on PR.In order to alleviate this problem at hand, Dr Sydney Kankuzi suggested there is a need to separate these two disciplines because they have different ideologies all together.“PR needs to be taught more systematically in all our training institutions, and to be practiced in ways that can help the industry grow,” he suggested.He continued that PR needs to be regulated so that those who will be practicing it will have a clear code of ethics.He urged the Universities and Colleges that teach PR to join hands with those in practice to spearhead the information of the professional body.A lecturer in the Department of Journalism and Media Studies, Peter Mitunda said it is a perfect and welcome distinction to pave a way for a fresh curriculum review in the foreseeable future. “We should welcome this academic innovation, bearing in mind that many pioneers now championing the media industry are from teaching background. Therefore; moving forward, organizations seeking to hire Public Relations professionals need the similar sensitization,” Mitunda said.He further said PR managers should be appropriately ranked in the industry to enable them impart and represent their organizations confidently.A fresh graduate of Journalism and Media Studies, Patuma Tonex said the lecture has enlightened her to differentiate Journalism and PR accordingly.“I seriously thought once one has been trained as a journalist, then he or she can just practice Public Relations. Through the lecture, I have learned that is not like that as Dr Sydney Kankuzi Put it; the two disciplines serve differently in the society. For instance, he said journalism serves in the interest of the people in the society, whilst PR serves in the interest of the particular organization,” she said.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/raphael-tenthani-series-reflects-on-training-and-practice-of-journalism-pr-in-malawi-06-12-2018

Mixed feelings over final year exams,Hazviperi Mbizi,"November 30, 2018","During this week of preparation popularly known as the Grace week, students are seen in small groups discussing what they have learned, commonly known as ‘Madisi’ during the whole academic year. Some are patronizing the Library which makes it to be full to the capacity more than the normal school days.One of the Library members of staff Murray Mwachumu observed that during this week the library is jam-packed than the normal days.“Students struggle and push each other in the morning when they want to enter, some even fight for particular places and the pace of borrowing of books has increased,” Mwachumu explained.A first year Bachelor of Civil Engineering Structure student Christopher Nkhata explained his fear of writing his first ever final exams saying he does not know what to expect.“I have been studying tirelessly day and night for fear of being ‘weeded’( withdrawn). I only know that when you do not do well in your final exams you get ‘weeded’. I even stopped watching movies until I finish exams,” Nkhata explained.Another first year Environmental Health student Charity Sopo added that she has also cut down some hours of sleep in order to study at night. She continued to say that although she has done well in her course work, this is not a reason enough to relax but fight on for a better average grade.While the first year students are skeptical about the exams, the final year students on the other hand are enthusiastic about it.A final year Bachelor of Science and Information Technology Sharon Nkukumira expressed her excitement about completing her studies after four years at the college.“It has been the longest four years full of fun and hard work but I am both excited and nervous to go out there. I intend to devote my skills that I have acquired into something productive not just waiting to be employed,” she explained.A Bachelor of Arts in Journalism final year student, Andrew Viano concurred with Nkukumira by saying he feels good that he is finally completing the four tiresome years of studying. While Nkukumira plans on investing her skills in entrepreneurship, Viano hopes that the potential employers should recognize his hard working spirit and employ him.The Polytechnic hostels which are normally noisy are now the unobtrusive places than the morgue, as students are busy either studying at the classes or at the library at all times.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/mixed-feelings-over-final-year-exams-30-11-2018
Outreaching Liwonde students with Business Communication Program,Chapter Banda,"November 30, 2018","The outreach was aimed at selling the Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication (BBC) Program to the students and motivating them. According to the organization’s Patron and lecturer in the Department of Language and Communication, Dr Murendehle Juwayeyi, their goal was to motivate the students so that they might be aspired to be part of the BBC community in the future.“We prompted to have a trip to Liwonde Secondary School, because as an organization of the Society of Business Communication students, we felt, we needed to come together to tell our story to the students. As you know, Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication program started in 2012. Due to this, many prospective BBC students out there do not know about it,” Juwayeyi explained.Juwayeyi further said the trip was important to the students because it is part of their refreshment as they are heading towards exams.“As a patron, I did feel that it was important for the students to go out and have this trip. Furthermore, it was important for the students to travel and refresh their brains as they are close to writing end of academic year exams,” Juwayeyi said.He added that the trips are important because they give an opportunity to the students to practice and showcase what they are doing in class.Juwayeyi continued that he has plans to keep on organizing such trips to the students because they are worthwhile.One of the lecturers who accompanied the students from the Department, Focus Maganga said they decided to accompany them because the outreach is one of the core activities that the academic members of staff should do.“The Polytechnic believes in commitment and responsiveness as some of its core values. As lecturers, we are also expected as part of outreach program to contribute our share towards the fulfillment of the College’s plans,” Maganga said.A third year Polytechnic student studying the Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication, Kings Kondowe said he has learnt that the University students have power to change negative mindsets towards education among Secondary School students.“There are many children in rural areas that go to school, but they lack motivation for them to do well in their studies. This means, they do not have role models who might inspire them to work hard in their studies,” Kondowe emphasized.Kondowe continued that the children who live in rural areas are the ones who needed to be visited and motivated frequently for Malawi to have well-skilled work force in the future.He thanked the SOBCS’ Executive and the Patron for organizing the trip and urged them to keep organizing such events.The students also visited Liwonde National Park as part of their educational tour.The SOBCS organization also conducted the similar outreach program in 2017 to Mulanje Secondary School students.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/outreaching-liwonde-students-with-business-communication-program-30-11-2018

One innovation done at the institution creates job opportunities to the industries thereby contributing to social economic development of Malawi,” Kululanga noted.Out of 19 shortlisted contestants only 16 attended the competition. The most outstanding project was a medical equipment management system.A MUST student Peter Amos Lettas, came up with the prototype to help medical personnel in the management of their equipment.“I thought of developing the medical equipment management system to ensure that there is an improvement in the working quality in our hospitals and also to bring easiness in managing the performance of medical equipment,” Lettas explained.The innovation was awarded the first prize worth MKW350,000 and a certificate of recognition.“I am just too excited to go away with that huge amount of money because I did not expect to beat all the contestants as I came late at the presentation while my friends had already started showcasing their prototypes. I thought I would not showcase mine,” Lettas explained.Mosquito Killer project developed by a Polytechnic student Clement Misomali and his friends, took the second place and won MKW250,000 together with a certificate.Voice-Text App for the deaf and dumb which was developed by a MUST student Isaac Chisembe and his friends, was third and won MKW100,000 plus a certificate.In other categories, participants got different awards such as the most innovative prototype which went to Elisha El-shaddai Kamanga for designing a convertible bed to wheelchair , the Lithoplastic building block prototype by Paul Chikopa which won an award in the category of best use of local materials and the EcoGen Bio-Energy won the award in the category of the most technically challenging prototype by Clement Kandodo.

WomEng workshop shines spot light on leadership skills among female engineers,Chapter Banda,"November 29, 2018","The workshop which was held in the institution’s Board Room on 22nd and 23rd November, 2018 respectively centred on three pillars. These include : leadership development and strengthening of the women in engineering chapter’s existing structure, training on how to conduct a Women in engineering outreach in high school and University level , and road mapping on outreach plan.The event was facilitated by WomEng Programme Coordinator Aditi Lachman and Letitia Mbulu from South Africa.The Facilitators tackled a lot of issues that are affecting female engineers in their work places. Among others, being an ideal of cultural set up in various countries across the world which underrates female engineers’ capabilities.During the event, it was discovered that female engineers received lower salaries compared to their male counterparts. In addition, very few women in engineering field are being trained and motivated to register with the board of Engineers though they are having same qualificationsAccording to the Women in Engineering—Malawi Chapter Coordinator, Faith Mzandu, the workshop was part of the Africa Catalyst Grant which Women in Engineering Global received from the Royal Academy of Engineering of United Kingdom. This was meant to help in strengthening WomEng Organizations in Malawi, Tanzania, Swaziland and Zimbabwe.“The aim of the workshop was to develop a team of leaders of female engineers from Malawi who will be able to conduct Women in engineering programs. These in turn will help them to run the projects in Women in Engineering Malawi on the behalf of the Global team,” Mzandu said.She further added that there are few female engineers in the world.“For instance, female engineers make about 11% of the total engineers globally and only 5% in Malawi. This means that the engineering industry is largely dominated by males,” she said.A lecturer from Malawi University of Science and Technology, Jennifer Chimwaza who also attended the workshop said she came there to gain leadership skills that would help her to understand how to help students whom she might inspire either at secondary school or university level.“The workshop has helped me to build some of the qualities that a good leader should have. Among others having a hardworking spirit, commitment and how a leader should portray in his or her everyday workings,” She said.A second year student at the Polytechnic studying Biomedical Engineering, Daisy Manyenje said she has learned a lot from the workshop.“I learned so many things, but there are two things that stood out for me. These are; event planning and how we need to support each other as female engineers,” Manyenje said.Manyenje further said the skills she has acquired will not help her only, but will also benefit other people as she will apply them in her everyday life.The participants had an opportunity to learn various things such as how to look for partners to finance a project, manage time effectively, how to conduct a program and how to market their projects.The WomEng is associated with the pink hardhat as its signature trademark. This pink hardhat symbolize how female engineers in the world will break a stereotype by taking the engineering safety and acts as a conversation starter towards what WomEng Global does, and how many women and girls are being reached by it.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/womeng-workshop-shines-spot-light-on-leadership-skills-among-female-engineers-29-11-2018
Extractive Industry seminar focuses on bridging gap that exist ,Chapter Banda,"November 27, 2018","The seminar which took place on Friday, November 16, 2018 was held in the institution’s main lecture theatre under the theme ‘The status and future of the Mining Industry in Malawi and Abroad,’ brought a lot of key stakeholders in mining sector including representatives from the government, corporate world and the academia.The seminar was aimed at inspiring the students and the academic members of staff through the provision of a collaborative environment and sharing of the ideas to map the way forward in mining sector.The event also tackled a variety of areas that are affecting mining sector in Malawi. Among others areas which were discussed were; the general overview of extractive industry in Malawi and abroad, permits and tenement procedure, challenges and opportunities in the extractive sector, current legislation framework in the extractive sector, status of rare earth project in Phalombe-Songwe-Hill project, and an update on Geological Mapping and Mineral Assessment Project in Malawi (GEMMAP)Speaking during the seminar, The Polytechnic Principal, Professor Grant Kululanga said the presence of private sector and public sector is fundamental to reform the educational system in Malawi.“For us to develop Malawi, we need all of us to join hands to reform the education system. Therefore, there is role which the private sector should play and what the government is continuing to play in order to promote higher education in the country,” Kululanga emphasized.Kululanga thanked the Royal Academy of engineering from United Kingdom for funding special projects in Southern part of Africa area which are aiming at bridging the engineering skills gaps that exist between the industries and the schools of engineering.He further added that they introduced the department of Mining Engineering at the Polytechnic after the government of Malawi wanted to diversify the country’s economy through mining to supplement agriculture.However, Kululanga appealed to key stakeholders and international community to sponsor the mining sector and support the department of Mining Engineering at the institution.Speaking at the same occasion, the former Minister of Mines and Natural Resources, Grain Malunga said the geology of the country helps the miners to relocate where minerals are found.“We are guided by the geology of Malawi to go for specific areas to look into specific rocks that are associated with the minerals,” Malunga elaborated.Malunga further outlined some of the challenges that the mining sector is currently facing. These include; poor infrastructure, few local service industries , limited skilled labour, administrative congestion related with high vacancy rate and corruption, small contracts to local companies, too much expatriate workers , unbalanced mine agreements and unfair benefit sharing.He further added that the education system in various Universities in Malawi should be relevant to the needs of the private sector.“We need to have a relevant education system that will produce graduates that are capable of doing things related to the extractive industry. These graduates will help us to alleviate some of the challenges that Malawi is currently facing as it is relying on foreign expatriate workers. For instance, a salary of the one expatriate worker at Kayelekela Uranium mine was equivalent to employ about seven local expatriate workers,” he said.He urged students to have business skills mindsets as they are graduating.“Apart from what you are learning here at the Polytechnic; you need to have business skills. As you are going out, you need to have a mentality of being employers not employees,” he advised.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/extractive-industry-seminar-focuses-on-bridging-gap-that-exist-27-11-2018
Journalism Students act the Play Animal Farm,Hazviperi Mbizi,"November 27, 2018","According to their lecturer, Victor Chikoti, Journalism students are the ones who are trained to disseminate information through writing, reporting, analyzing and professionally researching news on different media platforms.“These are the people that are tasked with writing and speaking, therefore they need to be conversant with literature and the use of language,” Chikoti explained.He further explained that, instead of just telling them to go and read the book he opted for them to give each other roles by coming up with costumes, vocal projection, stage design and props for the play. He added that this would help them once they graduate when practicing Journalism in the industry.“Animal farm is an allegorical Novella by George Orwell that reflects events leading to the Russian Revolution. It was banned by the first President of Malawi Dr. Hastings Kamuzu Banda because he noted that the events also applied to the then Malawi political system. By having students act this particular novel, it is one way of making them global citizens who appreciates global themes,” Chikoti said.One of the students, Johanna Chagunda who was also voted the best actress, said that the play was relevant to her as a journalist, in such a way that, there are some political issues like leadership and exploitation which Journalists are not free to address to the public.“In the book Animal Farm we see the type of dictatorship that exploits animals which did not have a chance to voice out their feelings. As a Journalist, I would like to be an instrument that will speak for the voiceless and be the bridge that connects the minority and the government,” Chagunda explained.Another Diploma in Journalism student, Annie Kakhomba who played the role of Clover the Donkey, explained that it has helped her to overcome her fears of approaching and interviewing people as a Journalist.“In the beginning it was hard because some of us had never acted before but due to team work we managed to come up with a masterpiece. This taught us that team work is always important in this profession,” Kakhomba said.The class was divided into two groups to compete against each other. Although this was the case each group was spectacular in their own way.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/journalism-students-act-the-play-animal-farm-27-11-2018

I drew my inspiration from observing such experiences,” he reminisced.He further said the story bodes well with the 2018’s theme of the competition which is looking for new voices and narratives in fighting for the girl child.Mgunda is competing against other works from countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Zambia.A Dance In The Dark short story talks about a girl who falls pregnant after sleeping with a man during some night dance and the man responsible cannot be traced.The winners will be announced during the 2018 African Writers Dinner/Awards which will be held at the International Conference Centre in Abuja, Nigeria.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnic-lecturer-shortlisted-for-african-writers-awards-14-11-2018
Engineering students symposium focuses on sustainable development,Chapter Banda,"November 14, 2018","The symposium which was held at Crossroads Hotel in Blantyre under the theme; ‘Sustainable Development through Engineering Innovations and Technology,’ brought a lot of key stakeholders in engineering progressions including representatives from the government, corporate world and academia.Speaking during the symposium a Deputy Dean in the Faculty of Engineering and a patron for the event, Dr Witness Kuotcha said the students are not yet engineering gurus as for that they need to keep on learning from experts.Kuotcha outlined three things which they need to put into consideration through what he experienced after graduating in 1993.“When I graduated from the Polytechnic in 1993 in civil engineering, I thought things would go smooth; but things were not like that , I had to learn from experts though they did not had a paper like mine but I had to learn from them,” he said.“Though am still learning, I have learnt three things that I would like to share with you. As students, you need to learn from your success not from mistakes because through your succession you can accomplish what others have failed. Secondly,as engineering students; you need to add a value to your degree ,people should appreciate your work and should bring a difference to the community and finally you need to follow your heart, following your heart will help you to achieve great things,” he continued.A Dean of the faculty of Engineering , Dr Gregory Gamula urged engineering students to use critical analytical skills that they have acquired from the college to bring a solution to the challenges that the nation is currently facing.“ We have equipped you with a lot of skills ; be innovative enough ,as you are the only hope of bringing sustainable solutions to current problems that Malawi is facing ,” Gamula said .He added that the students should not get discouraged from other people at but they should keep on moving forward and they should be able to overcome challenges that they might encounter.Speaking at the same occasion, Airtel Africa IT Director, Dr Matthews Mtumbuka, outlined among others that the graduates to be should be ambitious in everything they plan to do.He also encouraged them to be problems solvers who will be able to deliver accordingly.Mtumbuka added that the students should be eager to learn from experts while being unique in their own doing.The Guest of Honour Chief-Executive-Officer of Egenco, Engineer William Liabunya said the nations that are believing in engineers who have developed innovations that are sustainable, are ones that are developing economically.He further said that engineers are people who believe in ethics and not short cuts and he urged the students to be ethical once they have graduated .The students from all Departments of Faculty of Engineering had an opportunity to showcase their projects to the attendees . Kelvin Chilunga and Clement Misomali from the Electrical Department showcased their project which is mainly focuses on killing mosquitoes , a device called mosqui killer which uses a mini solar panel and a rechargeable battery of 9-volt.While Mechanical Department was represented by Webster Chipwaila and Moses Munyani who presented mechanical project called Dust Extraction Systems, which is mainly focusing on removing fly ashes from a three-boiler-plants at Castel Malawi LTD to a bin.Finally from the Civil Engineering Department , Chimango Mweso and Christopher Dzuwa also presented their project ,a software called Oasis Hydrosoft which will focus on monitoring the water flows within the supply systems of water boards in Malawi and will help in notifying them if there is a problem within that supply system in a form of signal to their master computer.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/engineering-students-symposium-focuses-on-sustainable-development-14-11-2018
National Bank awards outstanding university students,Hazviperi Mbizi,"November 9, 2018","The 2018 National Bank awards took place in the Polytechnic Main Lecture Theatre on November 9, out of the thirteen nominated student from the University of Malawi institutions, five of them are from The Polytechnic.From the Faculty of Applied Science the nominee is Goeffrey Mphangamo, a third year Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and Technology (Physics) who scored 78% average in the first semester of the 2018 academic year.Franco Khonjiwa, a Bachelor of Quantity Surveying student under the Faculty of Built Environment is the other nominee who notched 73% average.Mary Chisasa, who happens to be the only female among the five, got 78% on average from the Faculty of Commerce under the Bachelor of Accountancy program.From the Faculty of Education and Media studies, a Bachelor of Arts in Business Communication Student, Kings Ferrel Kondowe is the one who has been awarded after scoring 70% beating his fellow classmates.Under the Faculty of Engineering, Christopher Malili is the one who beat his fellow classmates by getting 78% average in his academic performance.Speaking, before presenting the awards, the guest of honour Professor John Kalenga Saka encouraged the nominated student to continue working hard so that they should graduate with distinctions.He also commended National Bank Of Malawi for the sponsorship which has been there for 39 years.A law student from Chancellor College, Ulemu Hanna Kanyongolo, speaking on behalf of the awarded students, thanked the University Of Malawi and National Bank, for this program which she said motivates and encourages students to work hard in their academics.“I would like to encourage my fellow students to use this support we get from our lecturers, families and friends to excel in our studies since the future is in our hands. Let us continue the good work for the good of the country,” Kanyongolo Said.The students have been presented with a Visa Debit Card each loaded with an equivalent of a one year academic school fees. The total sponsorship adds up to MK5Million.In the closing remarks, The Principal for The Polytechnic Grant Kululanga, thanked the audience for gracing the occasion. He also recognized the Board of National Bank for the awards and sponsorship it has been offering over the years meant for the outstanding students.“We believe that, if these events are being promoted frequently we may have a good crop of graduates from the University Of Malawi,” Kululanga added.He also encouraged the students to work hard and maintain integrity because Malawi needs graduates who are hard workers and performers not just getting distinctions in academics and fail to perform at the industry.In attendance were Deans Of Faculties from different Colleges under the University Of Malawi, Staff members from National Bank Of Malawi led by their Chief Executive Officer, McFussy Kawawa, Lecturers and Students.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/national-bank-awards-outstanding-university-students-09-11-2018
Polytechnic role models motivate secondary schools students,Chapter Banda,"November 9, 2018","The interactive sessions took place at Njamba Secondary school in Chitawira and at Chirimba Community Day Secondary school in Chirimba township on 6th and 7th November, respectively.This program attracted a lot of key stakeholders like the members of the academia, government officials, teachers and the local community.According to the symposium program coordinator, Alexander Mtambo, the interactive sessions were organized in order to dispel rumors that engineering programs are very difficult and are tailor made for males.“Engineering programs are like other programs;everyone can do it despite one’s gender. What matters is hardworking and doing whatever you want with a passion. For instance, in our class we have few ladies but sometimes they do better than us,” Mtambo said.In an interview with the General Secretary of the symposium organizing committee, Ashley Nkhukuzalira said they thought of interacting with senior secondary school students because it is the only way of thanking the communities that have served them for a while and it is one way of developing the country.“For the country to develop, it needs educated people; this is the reason why we thought it wise to inspire these secondary school students to work hard in their studies so that they can reach another level of education either doing engineering programs or other programs,” Nkhukuzalira said.Nkhukuzalira further said the inspirations will help these students to continue doing great in their lives.The students from both schools had an opportunity to change their negative mindsets towards education as the Polytechnic students envoy shared their lives’ experiences from secondary education to University level. The Polytechnic students envoy encouraged the secondary school students to work extra hard in all subjects and to put an effort in science subjects for them to study engineering programs despite their social status.The polytechnic students envoy also awarded the most outstanding students in their studies with various items such as Instrument sets , hard-note-books, and others were given monetary prizes.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnic-role-models-motivate-secondary-schools-students-09-11-2018
Polytechnic holds Entrepreneurship and Innovation Workshop,Mercy Garnet,"November 8, 2018","Sanyahumbi tackled a number of topics in his presentations. He began by defining innovation and entrepreneurship. Technology Innovation was simply defined as “an invention put to use” or in the equation format “technology innovation =invention + commercialization”According to Sanyahumbi, academia plays a key role in innovation and wherever possible, universities should explore the transfer of useful research outputs to socio-economic market places. “Universities need to be able to transfer relevant research outputs to the outside world as a return on investment on the public funding received from society at large ”Sanyahumbi emphasized.Innovation involves coming up with an idea, developing that idea and reducing it to use, protecting the intellectual property as appropriate, usually through patents for an invention. The Design Studio helps with developing prototypes which can be market-tested and then commercialized as appropriate. “Universities do not always get to develop and commercialize the final product” Sanyahumbi highlighted, but sometimes they license their IP for further development and commercialization by partners. Sanyahumbi also discussed the concepts of “publish or perish” and “innovate or perish” where he pointed out that researchers should by all means publish, but should consider protecting IP first wherever appropriate.An invention, in the form of a product, a service or a process, needs to be desirable to users, and it has to be technically and commercially viable in the market place. Sanyahumbi highlighted the need for human, social, financial, market, culture, knowledge , and physical capital for a successful innovation ecosystem.Sanyahumbi said entrepreneurs create value by identifying unmet needs or opportunities for change, and then identifying relevant solutions and organizing, managing and assuming the risks of starting a business around this. Entrepreneurs tend to see problems as opportunities.Technology innovation is not only helpful in increasing the local and international profile of the research being done, the researchers/ inventors and institution but it is also helpful in that it contributes to social and economic development.A third year student studying Geological Engineering, Omega Chirwa said she attended the workshop because she had so many ideas but just never knew where to start, so she wanted to learn more about innovation and entrepreneurship.“I have learnt more about innovation and entrepreneurship, the actual processes that involved, I have realized that it is not about just coming up with an idea and bringing it out there but it involves so many things including having an entrepreneurial mindset to come up with something unique,” said Chirwa.Having secured funding support from the Lemmelson Foundation, Rice University, based in Houston, Texas, partnered with the University of Malawi Polytechnic (UNIMA-Poly) and successfully developed and implemented a new model for invention education which spanned all the engineering programs at UNIMA-Poly.The long term goal of the partnership is to develop and deliver sustainable education programs that promote and support local technology innovation.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnic-holds-entrepreneurship-and-innovation-workshop-08-11-2018
Polytechnic receives government interns,Hazviperi Mbizi,"November 8, 2018","According to the Human Resource Manager, Gregory Banda, this is not the first time the college has been working with interns in various departments. He explained that as an academic institution he believes that this is the best platform for fresh graduates to gain relevant experience before they join the industry.Speaking during the meeting where he presented letters of assignment to various departments, Banda encouraged the interns to show commitment in their places of work which they have been assigned to.“As an academic institution we believe in our mission statement which focuses on the advancement of knowledge, professional competence and innovation in science, technology, commerce and other core values,” he explained.One of the interns, Tamandani Kaliwo said that she is grateful to be assigned to the Polytechnic because it is a place which has produced the most influential citizens in the country and beyond.Kaliwo, who has just graduated from LUANAR under the Environmental Science program, further explained that she is looking forward to gaining hands on experience which is mostly required when applying for jobs in the near future.A former journalism student of the Polytechnic, Fyson Masina, commended the Polytechnic for accommodating these fresh graduates for internship.“This is a good initiative; I was also an intern at the Polytechnic Journalism department where I was equipped with technical expertise. After graduating, I have ventured in the television production business where I am able to produce radio, television documentaries and adverts for both individuals and organizations,” Masina explained.The ten interns are fresh graduates from the institutions like LUANAR, MZUNI, Zanzibar University and The Polytechnic. They have been assigned to various departments like Finance, ICT, Environmental Health, Physics and Biochemical Sciences.

Motivation Hub inspires Orama students,Chapter Banda,"November 8, 2018","The inspirational talk, which attracted a lot of The Polytechnic students, was centered on four pillars:academic excellence, essence of discipline to academic performance, motivation and career guidance.According to Motivation Hub co-founder, Yamikani Chipangula, the talks were aimed at changing the negative perceptions that secondary school students have towards education as they undermine themselves based on which school they are learning.A third-year student studying Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering, Chikumbutso Walani, while talking about academic excellence, told the students about the differences between success and excellence.“Success is when one has achieved their goals whilst excellence means that one has improved in their daily operations,” Walani explained.Walani added that students need to change their attitudes to manage time effectively and to work hard for them to achieve greatness in their studies.The Polytechnic Students Union President and co-founder of Motivation Hub, Japhet Nthala, who tackled the remaining three pillars said the students can do better in their studies if they are willing to work hard and value education the most in their mindsets.Nthala said, “God created everyone with the potential of doing great things; what matters is hard work and understanding one’s capabilities.”He further used environment theory to teach the students why abiding by school rules is most important, despite one’s intelligence.He explained:“School rules are like a good environment, which a healthy tree needs to grow well; this applies to you as students no matter how hardworking and intelligent you are. Abiding by school rules will help you to excel in your studies.”On his part, a senior teacher from the school who accompanied the students, Luke M’bawa, said the talk has slightly changed some students’ mindsets toward education, as they had an opportunity to gain more knowledge from college students’ experience.M’bawa added that the talk has helped their work to be easier as, for them, teaching students who had no goals in their lives and lacked self-motivation was very difficult.“Students’ performance also depends on the perception that they have about themselves, though as teachers we do take responsibility to motivate them, but the inspirational talk will make a huge impact on our teaching,” he said.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/motivation-hub-inspires-orama-students-08-11-2018
The College Library donates books to members of staff,Hazviperi Mbizi & Mercy Garnet,"November 7, 2018","According to the Polytechnic Librarian Clement Fulano, the whole program aims at clearing the old books which have been in the library for so many years. He further explained that due to the advancement of technology, thecollege library has embarked on transforming the system from the print format to electronic.“Most of the journals are now electronic, therefore we want to encourage the students and the staff members to access these things electronically at the same time creating a good working environment because it creates a lot of space,” he elaborated.Fulano added that, as a center for studying, they receive a lot of books as donations which sometimes come in multiple copies of the same edition. This leads to over-crowding of books on the shelves which leaves little or no space for the remaining stock.One of the lecturers who has benefited from this program, Francis Masi, highlighted that this is a good gesture by the library because the books will help him in preparing and lecturing his modules to the students at the University.Masi also pointed out that despite helping him in lecturing; other books are just for general knowledge which, as an academician believes that knowledge is power.The Executive Officer for the student’s welfare, Patrick Kamoto, who is also studying a Master degree in Administration at the institution, commended this program citing that the books will assist him in his studies.“Owning these books will not only help us in our studies but also our family members in the future to come,” Kamoto added.This program intertwines with the incumbent process in which the library is building its database by digitizing some resources with the use of greenstone software.The Polytechnic Library has also extended this initiative to other institutions like Malawi Institute of Journalism (MIJ), Blantyre Synod and Colombia Universities.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/the-college-library-donates-books-to-members-of-staff-07-11-2018

Tenthani Series shines spotlight on media transformation in Malawi,Chapter Banda,"October 31, 2018","The lecture, presented by veteran journalist Felix Mponda titled ‘from one-party state to pluralism,’ was held at the Raphael Tenthani Centre for Media Excellence at The Polytechnic Chichiri campus.The presentation was spiced up by reminiscences on media practice in Malawi shared by seasoned journalists.Mponda began his presentation by explaining how the media industry in the country worked in the past and how is performing now. He shared his professional experiences from his time at the Malawi News Agency (MANA) which he joined at a tender age.“Working as a junior reporter at MANA during the one-party era, things were not easy at all as journalism was part and parcel of the party. I had to do all things involved in news production alone as no one could help me. Even editors were really tough if one wrote a story that was not good, they threw it back to the reporter,” he said.Mponda said the situation worsened during the 1960s when the Malawi Congress Party (MCP) government established the Censorship Board which monitored and censored media content.“The government started controlling the media after the Cabinet crisis of 1964. No foreign papers and journalists were allowed here in Malawi. A lot of mass media forms such as magazines, books, songs and periodicals were banned. Journalists were only allowed to write or report news articles that praised the government,” he reminisced.While praising the opening up of the media space during and after the referendum period of 1993, Mponda bemoaned the unethical journalism that accompanied the political changes taking place in the country.According to another veteran journalist, Willie Zingani, who also attended the lecture, unethical journalism remains a problem in the current media practice in Malawi.“One cannot distinguish between a hard news story and fiction because in both of them reporters have put their emotions. A hard news story should be based on facts, not the reporter’s opinions,” said Zingani.Karen Msiska, a journalism graduate from The Polytechnic, said besides the lack of objectivity, journalists in the country do not exhibit the hunger for reporting, resulting in journalism that is not based on facts.On his part, facilitator of the presentation and a lecturer in the Department of Language and Communication, Focus Maganga, said the lecture created a platform for participants to appreciate the history and context that have shaped the media in Malawi.“We cannot fully appreciate the practice and operating environment of our media if we don’t understand where our press is coming from. It was, therefore, a golden opportunity to have seasoned journalists who practised journalism in the one-party and tyrannical regime and still work in this democratic dispensation,” said Maganga.A final year journalism and media studies student, Happy Mwachande, said the presentation has helped him to put things into perspective.“There are a lot of issues that I have noticed in the media, especially negatives that until the presentation I thought were new in the industry,” said Mwachande.The Raphael Tenthani Series is an initiative of the Department of Journalism and Media Studies designed to provide a platform for scholarly and professional engagement on the media, politics and democracy in Malawi.

Students at the school were told about all three specialties that are offered by the department, including mathematics and statistics, mathematics and computing, and statistics and computing.Students and members of staff from the Polytechnic also engaged in role playing for the benefit of their audience, and there were several motivational talks, all in the spirit of giving the secondary school students some career guidance and a general sense of what studying at the Polytechnic would be like for them.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/reaching-out-with-mathematics-and-statistics-26-10-2018
Catholic alumni fundraise for needy students,Mercy Garnet & Chapter Banda,"October 25, 2018","The eight-kilometre walk started at 7 o’clock in the morning at the Polytechnic main campus via Chichiri Shopping Mall, St Columba CCAP Church, Kudya, Mount Pleasant through Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital and back to the college. Spicing up the walk were a variety of activities where participants had a chance to check their blood pressure.POCAS chairperson Joseph Dongolosi said the organization launched a scholarship fund after noting that some Catholic students were on the verge of withdrawing from the college because they could not sustain themselves in terms of fees and other needs.“Our ultimate goal is to support the most deserving Catholic needy students. In this academic year alone, we have 31 needy Catholic students who requested for alumni support and the total sum required is K4.1 million,” said Dongolosi.He said beneficiaries of the scholarship fund, whose main focus are tuition fees, include students who received partial loans from the Higher Education Students Loans and Grants Board and are struggling to square the balance.According to Dongolosi, apart from the health walk POCAS members are also making monthly contributions towards the initiative. He said POCAS has sent pledge forms to various organizations and other well-wishers for support because on their own the alumni cannot fill the gap.“We ask for more people to take heed of the request by POCAS to bail out our student colleagues at the Polytechnic,” he said.Leader-at-Large of the Polytechnic Catholic Student’s Organization (CSO) Mwayi Taulo said he was happy that the Catholic alumni have taken up the challenge of helping those in need of support.“We all hope to have a degree at the end of four or five years, so it is sad to hear that some are dropping out of school. Now, this initiative has eased our worries as our fellow students will be helped,” said Taulo.POCAS exists to integrate the spiritual and academic skills of the Polytechnic Catholic alumni towards the development of the Catholic Church and society at large.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/catholic-alumni-fundraise-for-needy-students-25-10-2018
NEF recognizes Ex-Poly Dean of Engineering ,Chapter Banda & Mercy Garnet,"October 22, 2018","Mkandawire received a certificate during the Africa Science Week (ASW) event which took place in Lilongwe in September this year.She was awarded alongside other eight women who also excelled in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and promotion of scientific work in general.In an interview, Mkandawire said she was happy and motivated though she was not there as she was also attending a similar function in China where she was the main speaker. She, however, encouraged more females to go for STEM.""Currently, we have a challenge as there are few females going for the STEM , so my passion is to reach out as many girls as possible to go for it,"" Mkandawire said.The former dean was the first lady to graduate in Civil Engineering with a distinction in 1993. ""For this reason, I want to be a role model for girls. It is lack of role models that is making most girls not to go for STEM,"" said Mkandawire.She added: ""I further urge young ladies to work hard and to have a desire to achieve what has not been done before as nothing comes on a silver platter. Young women should have self belief, courage, and be independent as well as focused.""The idea of having the Women in science commemoration and Girls STEM mini-conference for girls with female STEM professionals, during the ASW, promotes Gender mainstreaming and works on the observation that girls become insecure about STEM skills and thus underperform when mixed with boys, supporting the stereotype that boys, not girls, are good at Mathematics , Chemistry, Engineering ,and other Science and Technology fields.In Malawi, so far , gender mainstreaming is being promoted, where there is high activism in support of young women and adolescent girls in STEM with some winning prestigious prizes and awards like NEF ambassadors.NEF is an initiative of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) in partnership with Robert Bosch Stiftung was launched in 2013. In 2017 NEF’s ASW was held in 13 countries: Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire , Kenya , Malawi, Mali, Nigeria, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal,Tanzania, Sudan, South Africa. In this year’s event it has been extended to 35 counties and it is aiming at reaching out all the 54 countries by 2020.ASW event in Malawi had 60 participants which included nine outstanding awardees, students from Kamphenga CDSS located at Nambuma in Lilongwe, participants of Girl Code from mHub which comprises tertiary education students, and other female professionals in support of the function .The nine outstanding women in Science were: Dr Wezzie Mkwaila , Kundai Moyo , and Nthanda Chimwemwe Amin; Technology —Rachael Sibande and Phyllis Manguluti; in Engineering, Edith Naphiyo and Dr Theresa Mkandawire and finally in Mathematics, Dr Mwawi Nyirenda and Haliama.The event was sponsored by Johnson and Johnson, and supported by mHub and Malawi Girls in STEM.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/nef-recognizes-ex-poly-dean-of-engineering-22-10-2018
Raphael Tenthani Series holds public lecture on feature writing,Chapter Banda & Mercy Garnet,"October 1, 2018","The lecture, presented by a journalism and media studies alumnus of The Polytechnic, Mzati Nkolokosa and titled ‘Do Malawian feature writers achieve thread of continuity in their works?’ was held at the Raphael Tenthani Centre for Media Excellence, which is at The Polytechnic Chichiri Campus.Nkolokosa used Chinua Achebe`s novel Things Fall Apart in his presentation as an example of good flow with thread of continuity.He said a thread of continuity is a concept of creative writing that makes a story flow from sentence to sentence, paragraph to paragraph, chapter to chapter and throughout.“Good writers have a tendency to end their story where it begun,” Nkolokosa said, adding that Achebe used different techniques to achieve a thread of continuity which included: place, date, activity and the use of related words.However, while the audience agreed with some aspects of the presentation, they questioned why the presenter used the novel and not feature news pieces.Series coordinator, Temwani Mgunda argued that Nkolokosa would have used one of his best feature pieces or any well-written feature as a case study for his presentation.“I would have loved if he used a feature and not a novel to demonstrate how feature writers can achieve thread of continuity in their works,” Mgunda said.A participant, Albert Sharra who is a prolific feature writer at Nation Publications Limited (NPL) conquered with Mgunda, saying the presentation turned into more or less like a literature class.However, Nkolokosa argued that feature writing is a creative writing activity as such feature writers must employ all rules of creative writing as is the case with novelists or other creative writers.A final year Journalism and Media Studies student, Blessings Saka, said the Tenthani Series presentations are very rich in content and that they offer great insights from those currently in the industry.“I have met the likes of Albert Sharra and Felix Mponda who are veterans and in due course, I am learning a lot from their experiences especially through the discussions at the end of each public lecture,” Saka said.The lecture on Friday attracted different stakeholders who included Journalism students, Alfred Msadala who is a columnist for The Sunday Times, Ayami Mkwanda who is also a feature writer at NPL, Dave Namusanya who is former arts editor at Times Group and Henry Mchazime, a former Business Editor at Times Group.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/raphael-tenthani-series-holds-public-lecture-on-feature-writing-01-10-2018

We have come up with a design which will be implemented into a K54 million health clinic to be built in the township,” said Tukula.He said, so far, they have managed to raise K532,000 in cash and pledges.“The students had to use their money to make banners as well as book the police and the public address system, among others. We did not expect to make much money this time, but what we wanted most was to create public awareness,” Tukula said.According to him, the students have already approached PLASCON Company which has promised to provide paint while SAFINTRA will provide iron sheets. Horizon B, CEC Constructions and Einstein Constructions Company have contributed towards the symposium.This is not the first time the Built Environment students have carried out similar work. In 2016, they came up with a street cleaning campaign in Blantyre Market and in 2017 they mounted a ‘Keep the City Clean’ campaign.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/built-environment-students-fundraise-for-health-clinic-01-10-2018
Polytechnic holds WiSci alumni workshop ,Mercy Garnet & Chapter Banda,"September 19, 2018","During the event, Dr Richards presented the girls with two challenges. The students were asked to brainstorm and to create a new solution or technology to solve a public health challenge. The first challenge involved improving on the milk-drip device, which allows mothers of premature infants to pour milk into a cup attached to an orogastric tube to feed their infants. The problem was that the milk-drip device often resulted in overfeeding of infants.The team was put into groups to develop a low-cost device that allows infants to control the pace of feeding. The criteria were that the device must be able to do the following: accurately measure a volume of 5-40 ml, be reusable, be easy for illiterate mothers to use, and be easy to clean.The last challenge was to come up with an insulin device as a solution to diabetes, a disease in which the person has high blood glucose (blood sugar), either because insulin production is inadequate, or because the body`s cells do not respond properly, or both. Accurate measurement and administration of insulin is a challenge for elderly patients, or those with low-literacy and numeracy skills. Consequently, the team was tasked with developing a low-cost device that is compatible with current insulin syringes to ensure accurate dosage for patients with low literacy or numeracy skills, or with poor vision.Some of the criteria were that the device must be of low cost and must be easy for patients or community health workers to use with compatible insulin syringes of less than 1ml.Every member participated by jotting down an idea, which was then explained to fellow members; simple sketches were drawn for illustration. The sketches were then stuck to a board where everyone could see.Every idea was analyzed based on its feasibility and impact. The one that had high feasibility and impact stood out to be the best idea. This was used for prototyping using many kinds of different materials that were available. One member from each group presented the prototype to the whole team. Finally, two teams with the best prototypes were recognized.The students also had the opportunity to learn more about one of the technologies developed by 2016 Polytechnic engineering graduates, Francis Masi and Andrew Ndalama. They developed a phototherapy dozing meter (blumeter), which is a device that measures the amount of blue light required to treat children with Jaundice.Francis Masi demonstrated how the blumeter works by explaining what the readings represent on the blumeter when treating patients. The blumeter has readings ranging from 0-15, 15-30, 30-65 and above.Francis Masi - demostrating how the blumeter works“If the readings range from 0-15, it means that the blue lights are too low for a patient to be treated. If the ranges are from 15-30, it means that the patient can be treated, but with some problems, and from 30-65, it means that the patient can be treated effectively without any problem. Finally, if the readings range above 65, the patient has been too exposed to blue lights and cannot be suitably treated,” he explained.Masi has encouraged Poly students to utilize the knowledge and skills they acquire from their different studies to develop various prototypes that can contribute to the economic development in Malawi.Currently, Francis Masi and Andrew Ndalama are working as project managers at Polytechnic design studio. Francis Masi has a Bachelor of Science in Telecommunications and Electronics Engineering, and Andrew Ndalama has a Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. Their blumeter is currently being used in various hospitals.Ms Jacquiline Malombe -presenting a milk device to theparticipantsA first -year student from University of Malawi—College of Medicine Jacqueline Malombe said that she had learnt that everyone can find simple solutions to some of the problems through brainstorming, designing and engineering. “I guess that those who did not attend the workshop missed out on the opportunity to learn and get exposed to some of the situations, and they should probably attend if there is a next workshop,” she said.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnic-holds-wisci-alumni-workshop-19-09-2018

Dumisani Kaliati: The dynamic digital health innovator,Lusungu Munthali,"January 30, 2018","The 2017 graduate in Bachelors of Science in Information Technology has a strong passion for technology and a burning desire for constant innovation. When Dumisani was young, he was fascinated by the working principle of magnets, which opened his mind to a world of discovery and creative thinking.His skills in technology and desire for innovation strongly increased in 2015 when he got introduced to microcontroller devices which he loved so much, and later he developed a security system based on it aimed at protecting assets of the people in his community. In September 2015, he attended 3 days intensive entrepreneurship training organized by the 3 Day startup which opened his mind to entrepreneurship.Being raised by a single parent, Dumisani witnessed the economic challenges his mother went through to provide for him and his sister and this combated with high levels of poverty and high levels of the unemployment rate in Malawi, Dumisani saw the need to turn his passion for technology into a money generating activity.He founded Micromek in December 2015 as a microcontroller-based systems prototyping startup, which he bootstrapped and run in his college dorm.Later in 2016 he came up with another innovation called TDOSE, an SMS reminder prototype system device aimed at supporting hospitals in improving the out-patient medication adherence to the hospital prescribed dosage and the sending of healthy tips through the use of automated SMS reminder messages as a means of improving adherence to hospital medication and providing remote access to hospital information to the citizens living in rural areas of Malawi who are mostly faced with mobility challenges due to poor road networks and bad terrain.Later in Early 2017 Dumisani co-founded and developed Peza a social venture aimed at exposing and connecting blue-collar workers such as plumbers, and electricians in Malawi to their potential clients near them via web and mobile technology as a means of reducing unemployment level in the informal sector which contributes to about 89% of the total labor economy in his country.In November 2017 Dumisani was trained in production and operation of low cost design unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) with Dr. Kevin Kochersberger of the Virginia Tech University and the UNICEF at the UNICEF Humanitarian drone corridor in Kasungu Malawi where they successfully run over 19 km autonomous drug delivery flight test mission from a rural health center in Kasungu to the drone corridor test site.His startup, Micromek is now exploring the prospect of locally producing and maintaining the low cost unmanned aerial vehicles to be used by hospitals and relief organizations in delivery of emergency drugs, child vaccines, lab test samples and blood products to disaster areas and the remote rural health centers of the developing world in Malawi and across Africa.It will overcome any mountains, poor and flooded road networks and bad terrain which currently stand as major barriers to timely access to hospital resources in the remote areas of the developing world.He also received the entrepreneurship innovation award by the ICT Association of Malawi and emerged as the winner of Blantyre pitch night competition and 3rd place winner in the Poly Design competition with Peza.Dumisani has enjoyed a list of mentorship through local entrepreneurship hubs such as The Poly Design studio, Mhub, Blantyre Entrepreneurs Hub, and with Dr Kevin Kochersberger of the Virginia Tech University.Dumisani envisions of using technology as a means of elevating poverty and providing better access to health resources to the people in his country. He dreams of employing more than 5000 youths through his startup and on the other hand being a motivation to the youth and upcoming young innovators in his community.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/dumisani-kaliati-the-dynamic-digital-health-innovator-30-01-2018

Final year Engineering students develop a Car Accident Prevention System,Lusungu Munthali,"November 23, 2017","The two, Innocent Matchipisa, an Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering student and Marumbo Sichinga, an Electronics and Computer Engineering student teamed up to develop a system dubbed Accident Prevention.The system aims at preventing accidents by monitoring the drowsiness and drunkenness of the driver through the use of a Camera, GPS monitor and Alcohol sensor. When a person is drunk, the sensor senses the alcohol, which then transmits a signal to the car to reduce speed. If it happens that the drunken driver is about to start the engine the car does not at all start.However, in the case that a driver is dosing the camera is able to detect the rate at which the driver is blinking hence the car is able to reduce speed while beeping an alarm for the driver to wake up. If the driver does not wake up, then the car comes to a complete stop. The system has a Global Positioning System (GPS) and a messaging facility, which can be used to track the location of the car then send messages to relatives and workmates to come and help the driver.The idea of the system came two years ago after Marumbo was involved in an accident. It took 4 months to develop it as a final year project and has won the Malawi Innovators Design Competition in the category of Most Technically Challenging Innovation. The Faculty of Engineering organized the competition with the support from Rice 360 University.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/final-year-engineering-students-develop-a-car-accident-prevention-system-23-11-2017

NEST360 is finalist for $100 million MacArthur grant,Rice University,"October 26, 2017","NEST360°is one of four 100&Change finalists named today by the foundation. One finalist will be awarded $100 million in December.The 100&Change competition, which began more than a year ago, aims to solve one of the world's critical problems. The competition drew more than 1,900 applications, and eight semifinalists were selected in February.NEST360°, an international effort by physicians, engineers, entrepreneurial and business leaders, is firmly rooted in Africa, a continent where more than 1 million babies die each year, mostly from preventable causes. The technology needed to save their lives has been available in the United States and most European countries for more than 50 years, but the equipment used in those countries is not built to last in the harsh environments of African hospitals.NEST360° will optimize and scale a package of these ""newborn essential solutions and technologies""(NEST) for Africa,train healthcare workers to use NEST, work within African healthcare systems and markets to generate demand for NEST and create a distribution network to provide NEST continent-wide. Within 10 years, NEST360° estimates it could reduce newborn death rates by 50 percent and save 500,000 lives per year at a cost of $1.48 per birth, which is less than the cost of some routine vaccines. In addition, NEST360° will work with African universities, medical schools and colleges to involveAfrican engineers and entrepreneurs in the NEST transformation so they cansustain the change and transform otherhealth sectors.""Our team has worked together to improve newborn health for 12 years, and we have designed our program to be the lever that will catalyze continent-wide change,"" said NEST360°'s Rebecca Richards-Kortum, a bioengineering professor and global health leader from Rice University. ""Our 100&Change activities will generate proof -- and more importantly belief -- that a solution to the persistent challenge of poor outcomes for newborns is within reach. Not only will this save the lives of 500,000 newborn babies every year, it will create long-lasting systems change that can help solve other healthcare challenges both in Africa and beyond.""NEST360°'s roots are in the east African nation of Malawi. Work began there a decade ago by Rice 360° Institute for Global Health to design simple technologies that keep babies warm, help them breathe, help doctors manage infection and solve other problems.

He advised that in order for Malawi to be developed there is need for strict measures to avoid illegal allocation of customary land.The Dean of the Faculty, Mr Rodrick Chilipunde agreed that there are serious land problems in the country and that as a faculty they would ensure better governance of land in order not to exploit the precious resource.The conference was a major insight to the Faculty as a whole and the stakeholders who are to prepare in order to avoid problems that may arise in the near future.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/the-polytechnic-holds-national-conference-on-land-governance-11-09-2017
Encouraging female students pursue science programmes,Lusungu Munthali,"September 11, 2017","It is so worrisome to the see a minimal percentage of female students pursuing science programmes and let alone taking an initiative to discover something more profound in the science arena.it is so ironic to see that unlike female students taking the example of the first programmer who was female by the name Ada Lovelace. For instance, at the Polytechnic, according to the faculty of Engineering, female students constitute about 23% of the total intake. On the other hand, looking at the human resource capacity especially at the faculty of engineering, female academic staff members constitute 8% of the total with no female academic member of staff in the Mechanical engineering department.Looking at the situation on hand, female engineering students established Polytechnic Association of Female Engineers (PAFE), an organization aimed at bringing out the best grain in every female engineering student and in turn increase a formidable amount of girls that graduate from the faculty. This organization is planning to have a database whereby all female students will be registering.On the other hand, the Polytechnic through Skills Development Project funded by the World Bank embarked on a programme that provides bridging courses for all female science students. The programmes which started in the 2016-2017 academic calendar is expected to continue in the following years as a way of inspiring the female students to pursue their programmes with courage and determination.In a public lecture that took place on 10 August 2017 by former National Aeronautics Space Administration (NASA) astronaut, Leland Melvin, he highlighted on the need to educate the girl child in the field of science because diversity is the key to solving problems in the world. “We need to make girls feel like they are part of the solution for most of the times they are not” he said.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/encouraging-female-students-pursue-science-programmes-11-09-2017
Faculty of Engineering  hosts a workshop on higher education partnership for HEPSSA project ,Harris Chimatiro,"September 11, 2017","The Universities, which include Lilongwe University of Agriculture and Natural Resources (LUANAR), Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST), DMI St John the Baptist University, Addis Ababa University (AAU), and Uganda Martyrs University converged at the Polytechnic which is the Hub of the spoke Universities in Malawi.The Principal of the Polytechnic, Professor Grant Kululanga officially opened the workshop. In his speech, the Principal highlighted that the industry and the government have to work hand in hand to bring solution to the nation; a one-way treat will in no way give solutions. He therefore underscored for lectures in the Faculty of Engineering to learn from colleagues who have vast Industrial experiences.The attendees of the workshop benefited from different keynote speakers, Professor Kassahun Yimer Kebede from Adidis Ababa University, Sebastian Scott representing the Royal Academy of Engineering, Engineer Wilson Chirwa, Vice President of Malawi Institute of Engineers, Dr Kaunda, Faculty of Engineering, Dr Gamula, deputy Dean of Engineering, Dr Chinyama and Vincent Mbewe, a final year Mechanical Engineering student from the Polytechnic. These learned colleagues set the tone of the Workshop as they presented their different experiences on how to address Engineering skills shortage in Malawi through University-Industry collaboration.These different key speakers shared their vast experiences on how to address the shortage of Engineering skills in Malawi, Professor Kebede was the first to share his experiences on what the (AAU) is doing with the problem of Engineering skills shortage in Ethiopia. On the other hand, Dr Gamula presented on projects that the Faculty of Engineering is carrying out to address skills shortage. These projects involve Developing the curriculum of Engineering to be inline with what the Industry requires by engaging professional Engineers to train students on industrial experiences, attaching members of staff in the Faculty of Engineering to the Industry for a specified period of time to gain Industrial experiences and attaching Engineering students to different industries to get industrial experiences. During the workshop, Vincent Mbewe, a final year Mechanical Engineering student who went for an attachment at Illovo, was given a chance to present what he experienced.Higher education Partnerships for the Sub-Saharan Africa (HEPSSA) with support from Royal Academy of Engineering, is a project that addresses skills shortages and enhances the role of engineering in driving the economic development of Malawi and other countries in the sub Saharan Africa region through University-Industry collaborations. In addition, it enhances networking and collaboration between universities in this consortium.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/faculty-of-engineering-hosts-a-workshop-on-higher-education-partnership-for-hepssa-project-11-09-2017
The Polytechnic to wear a new face,Poly News,"August 30, 2017","For a long time, the Polytechnic has been providing students with high quality education. However, due to lack of modern scientific laboratories, classrooms and lecture theaters, the college has been struggling in the area of research and in marketing the relevance of its programmes such as Engineering to the stakeholders.This has been a setback for students who have been graduating with good scientific research projects that could benefit Malawi, but due to lack of modern scientific laboratories the projects could not be implemented.The Polytechnic is now going to wear a new face as these laboratories will be the core centres of research for students pursuing science programmes at the institution. This will be in line with the mission of the institution, which is to advance in knowledge, professional competences and innovations in science, technology, commerce and communication through excellence in demand driven education, research, consultancy and outreach.This will also identify Polytechnic among many institutions of higher learning around the world that are recognized on the basis of their research projects. Further more the college will undertake tracer studies and bridging courses to improve the performance of students in science subjects.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/the-polytechnic-to-wear-a-new-face-30-08-2017
Polytechnic's female students benefit from ESCOM’s scholarship programme,Poly News,"August 29, 2017","Speaking at the launch, ESCOM’s Chief Executive Officer, John Kandulu, said this is in line with ESCOM strategy. “ESCOM is committed to reducing gender imbalances. This is a deliberate effort that we have put in place and are pursuing.” Said Kandulu while highlighting the importance of involvement of women in technical fields such as engineering.Speaking on behalf of the students, Mary Mnewa, one of the female students, thanked ESCOM for the award while promising to keep working hard. “This award means a lot to me.

While noting that the composition of female engineers in Malawi is less than 1%, Kululanga commended ESCOM for the scholarship program. “Female engineers in Malawi are very scarce. We need to encourage and support them so we can increase the numbers.” Said Kululanga while encouraging other organizations to emulate ESCOM.The scholarship which will run for an initial period of four years is being made in fulfillment to an undertaking ESCOM made with government to commit to gender parity. As part of the scholarship, the students will be offered internship at ESCOM during their holidays.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnics-female-students-benefit-from-escoms-scholarship-programme-29-08-2017
Polytechnic Seventh Day Adventist students cheer the sick,Poly News,"August 21, 2017","The evangelical chairperson, Emmanuel Chauya who is in charge of the visits said it is in one`s troubled times when one needs God the most. He also stressed on the point that their initiative will somehow help to create a good image of Polytechnic in the eyes of the public.“We are also trying to get rid of the bad reputation that is associated with Polytechnic students, we are often portrayed as barbaric, heartless and selfish creatures,” added Chavula. “We hope that this perception will change through this initiative.”“As his words in the book of Isaiah 53 verse 5: that by his stripes we were healed, we thought it wise to tell These people about the goodness of Christ and also get them prepared for the next life by accepting Jesus Christ to be their Lord and personal saviour,” he explained.The students visit the hospital twice a week, on Sundays and Thursdays. Speaking on behalf of the hospital’s administration, the Matron, Stella Mkalima said the encouragement and prayers the students provide goes a long way in giving hope and courage to the sick.“We provide the medicine and the care but it is God that heals,” she said. It is with this initiative that George kausiwa; one of the patients at the hospital has received Jesus Christ as his personal Lord and savior.Chairperson for the club, Timothy Chavula, said they thought of this initiative as a way of giving back to the society the little that they have.“The donations come from the money collected as offering during church services and no one is sponsoring us yet,” said Chavula. “If there is anyone interested in sponsoring the initiative out there, their support will be welcomed.”“It is a great gift to receive Jesus than these other things that we bring. We bring items for the sick at least once a month but for the other visits, it is strictly to spread the world of God which is the main focus of this initiative,” he added.“I have been in this hospital for four months without having anyone coming to see me, not even my relatives,” he complained. “Having been admitted at the hospital after surviving a road accident, I have seen that the Lord will never forsake me.”Kausiwa is one among many of the patients that have benefited from this new initiative by the students.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/polytechnic-seventh-day-adventist-students-cheer-the-sick-21-08-2017
The good life festival,Poly News,"August 21, 2017","This social gathering however is not enjoyed by every student on campus simply because of different beliefs in faith. As a matter of fact some students feel alienated this time of the semester because they do not find a chance to interact with their fellow students in the same way social weekenders do.Looking at the situation at hand, Christians in the Polytechnic Church decided to come up with an event that aims at drawing Christians and other non-believers together. This event is called the Good Life Festival.The Good life festival is not a confrontation to the social weekend, as it does not force anybody to be apart of it. By virtue of being in tandem with the secular event it is there to act as a balance and offer a variety from which one can decide the event to attend. The venue of the festival clearly displays that there is no intention of causing havoc as it is hosted at the Chichiri campus, which is a few kilometers away from the main campus where the social weekend takes place.The festival seeks to embrace the culture we have as Malawians as there are a number of activities that take place at the festival, which include music, games, poetry, dance as well as selling of assorted traditional food. This initiative takes a step further as it allows parents to come visit and partake in the event.These parents interact with students more thereby sharing experience and advice. This will encourage discipline in the lives of the students as they will be aware that whatever they do will have consequences on both their lives as well as those looking up to them. It is just a cliché that college students are grown and can make decisions on their own, some fail to govern their lives properly hence need special guidance and counseling something the festival will be offering.The Festival is simply a retreat. As children of God, we must gather under one roof as Psalms 133:1 says, “Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in harmony”. We want people from outside, and kids to come and interact with us. We will discuss pressing issues affecting us youth and possibly figure out a way on how to curb our problems. This can only happen at a place where people are sober minded and calm. There will be Question and Answer forums on which guest preachers, full of the knowledge of the word of God, will answer all our questions and direct us to the right way.",http://www.mubas.ac.mw/news/the-good-life-festival-21-08-2017
